## Commands
* pip3 install pandas
* pip3 install numpy
* pip3 install matplotlib
* pip3 install seaborn
* pip3 install statsmodels

## Data Processing
-  Loading datasets with 65k games and selected columns.
-  Checking for missing values in datasets and cleaning them by dropping rows of missing values.
-  Feature engineering new columns to plot against win rate.

### Loading Datasets
- The project loads datasets with 65,000 games and selected columns.

### Missing Values
- Checks for missing values in datasets and cleans them by dropping rows with missing values and duplicates


## Analysis and Visualization
The analysis includes:

- Total Gold Distribution
- Kills and Gold Relationships
- Game Duration Analysis
- Impact of Champion Kills on Win Rates
- Impact of Gold Differentials on Win Rates
- Impact of Dragon Kills on Win Rates
- Minions Killed Analysis Win Rates smoothed and unsmoothed


## Training and Modeling (Yet to be Implemented)
The project will include a training and modeling aspect to enhance predictive capabilities. This will involve the use of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

## Usage
